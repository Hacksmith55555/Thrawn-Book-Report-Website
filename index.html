            <p>Fantastic read. Honestly cannot recommend enough. It’s a real page turner from beginning to end. I could not put it down while reading the book.
                 It has a very steady plot, engaging story, amazing characterisation and it makes you question the morality of the story throughout. 
                You are also hooked throughout with the mystery to the identity of the main antagonist known as Nightswan. 
                It is also fun seeing the growth of the relationship of Thrawn and Eli, acting as the Sherlock homes and John Watson of the Novel. 
                Nightswan acting as the thorn in Thrawns side, his Moriarty of sorts. There are many emotional moments through the course of the story, as we experience thrawns journey, 
                facing the Racism, prejudice and corruption within the Empire left over from the Clone wars. 
                This book also links very well into the established canon of Star Wars Rebels too. Overall I give the Book a 9/10 rating. A must read if you haven’t already. Xx</p>

            <p>Absolutely amazing book. I could not ask for a better origin story for Thrawn than this. 
                The character development in this book is top notch. For anyone who is interested in Star Wars beyond just the movies, do yourself a favor and pick this book up.</p>
